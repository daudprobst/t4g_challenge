# Create React App

The frontend for this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run offline`

Runs the app locally. Starts both client and server. \
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
For development you can separately start server and client to see the outputs.

### `npm run client`

Will start only the client.\
If you only run the client without the server, the data will not get fetched properly.

### `npm run server`

Will start only the server.
